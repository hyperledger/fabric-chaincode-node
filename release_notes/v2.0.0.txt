v2.0.0, 22 January 2020
-----------------------

Release Notes
-------------
The main change in the v2.0.0 is the level of NodeJS runtime has moved up to the latest LTS version of v12.13.0 
v2.0.0 has the fixes from v1.4.4 level.

Migration Notes
---------------
Note that a change needed to be made to the metadata schema as it was in error; it had diverged from the JSONSchema standard
so that it was not possible to validate complex objects.

If you have custom metadata defined in the contract, then for the complex objects defined in the 'components' section
the properties of this object where previously held as array; they now need to be held as a map with the key as the name
of the property

Return types on functions where returned as an array of schema objects. this has been modified to be a single object. i.e. 
the single value array is now just a single value.

There is also a new nodeenv docker image that is used for hosting the chaincode rather than use the baseos image as in V1.4

In v1.4, the fabric-contract-api had a dependency on the fabric-shim.  This has changed in this version to have a dependency
on the new fabric-shim-api module. This allows the fabric-contract-api to be used client side for annotations. 

For contributors, the v2.0.0 repo is built using rush and is organized as a full mono-repo.

The @Object annotation has been deprecated in favour of the @DataType annotation

The x509 library used for parsing has changed; this should be parse the X509 certificates exactly the same way; this is a note that
differences are observed in the parsed certificates please raise an issue.
