Release Notes
-------------

- FABCN-418 Dependency unable to use git

  Locks the version of the winston library to 3.2.1
  The updated winston library after 3.3.0 prevents chaincode installing due to
  a new requirement for git which is not available in the
  hyperledger/fabric-nodeenv docker image.

The release-2.0 branch has been renamed to release-2.x; the v2.1.0 release supercedes v2.0.0.
The release-1.4 branch is currently LTS, please see the proposed Fabric LTS strategy for more information:
