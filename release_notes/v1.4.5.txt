v1.4.5 5th February 2020
-----------------------------

Release Notes
-------------
This is a maintence release and contains bug fixes, and minor updates. 

- The version of the x509 library has been updated so the library can now
  be built with NodeJS v12
- The checks on the number of parameters passed to a Java Script contract are
  enforced
- previously the npm modules were shrinkwrapped; with the devDependencies
  this has been changed so the final module size is smaller

  Note that contract and chaincode implementations are strongly advised to 
  shrinkwrap their own code
