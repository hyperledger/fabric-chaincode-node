v1.4.1 March 29, 2019
-----------------------------

Release Notes
-------------
Fabric 1.4.1 builds upon the new programming model introduced in Fabric 1.4. 0.
Specific addtions include

- Updates to the context object to provide contract developers with an easy to use logging system. Rather than console.log
- Updates to the @Param and @Return annotation to generate beta metadata
- The `fabric-chaincod-node metadata generate` command can be run to obtain a local copy of the metadata for augmentation

Migration Notes
---------------
Note that a change needed to be made to the metadata schema as it was in error; it had diverged from the JSONSchema standard
so that it was not possible to validate complex objects.

If you have custom metadata defined in the contract, then for the complex objects defined in the 'components' section
the properties of this object where previously held as an array; they now need to be held as a map with the key as the name
of the property

Return types on functions where returned as an array of schema objects. this has been modified to be a single object. i.e.
the single value array is now just a single value.

Summary of the programming model
-------------------------------

This is designed to improve developer productivity and ease of use.
A new NPM package `fabric-contract-api` is added that lets the developer focus on the functions they want to invoke
within the chaincode. They can also modularize their applications into 'Contracts' by extending a Contract class.

See https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/developapps/developing_applications.html

To help client applications, and tooling and to make working with the transaction functions easier, a defined
schema of Contract Metadata has been introduced. Depending on language a large part of this can be automatically created.
Typescript Annotations are provided that are very useful in creating this data.

See https://fabric-shim.github.io/contract-schema.json


On the client application side, a new NPM package `fabric-network` is added which contains the classes and methods for writing
blockchain enabled applications in node.js using javascript or typescript.

See https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/module-fabric-network.html
